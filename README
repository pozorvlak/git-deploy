git-deploy: Git plugin to enable one-touch deployment.

There are many others like it, but this one is mine.


USAGE

1) Push to a bare repo somewhere - GitHub, perhaps.
2) Set up passwordless ssh login on the host you intend to deploy to.
3) git-clone your GitHub repo on the deployment host.
4) In your development repo, set up some configuration variables:

$ git config --add deploy.host [deployment host]
$ git config --add deploy.dir  [directory of checkout on deployment host]

5) Deploy your code:

$ git deploy


DISCUSSION

Only a fool would attempt to deploy a site by pushing to a non-bare repo. This
script doesn't do that. Instead, it assumes you have three repos:

1) A development repo, probably on your local box.
2) A central bare repo on a hosting site or company VCS server.
3) A deployment repo, from which your code actually runs.

This script, when run in (1), will push to (2), ssh to (3) and then pull from
(2) to (3).


FIXMES

It may be a very bad idea to combine pushing and deployment like this. Then
again, maybe it's a great idea. I have yet to find out.

It would be nice to have a nicer way of setting up the necessary variables.

The initial checkout on the deployment repo could be done automatically.
